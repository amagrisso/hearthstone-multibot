Hearthstone Multibot /w Twitch/IRC Support

Next Gen Twitch/IRC Hearthstone Bot Enabling IRC networks to interact with a streamer.

This project is designed to consolidate many of the fatures of similar IRC bots. Planned features include a multi-functional channel bot, which in addition to the usual tooltips, the software will rank cards based on their stats and abilities alone with a numerical score. These will be consistent across all cards. The value should not be mistaken for the potential value of the card in specific (every time it's played) cicumstances.

The bot will store card data in XML format in addition to a database. The database will be able to schedule times play arena matches, so your friends can play with you (ideally watching you and not fighting you). Stats from any of the standard spreadsheet-type stat-trackers, will be available for inmport to a local database.

The project is planned for multiple languages, including Python, Perl, and mIRC scripting. The whole package will include a pre-setup bot for your twitch stream, with the feature set completely up to you. Plans include a trivia bot, with the goal of keeping attention spans, but most importantly, the bot on your stream, can be used to display the channels, chat during the broadcast, adding to the value of the archived video. A small dedicated window has the option of running on top of Hearthstone, for you to type to the camera, if you so desire.

I am highly disappointed in all the efforts made so far by any similar projects, and I know of many others who have expressed the same feelings. This project is designed to mostly replace their functionality, with a "thought of outside the box" solution. For the good of the community. Contributors are more than welcome, and I would love to hear any thoughts of features, as I know I don't code something unless there's nothing out there that satisfies me, so my intention is to produce the best possible solution for everybody who is interested in this game. For anybody's who's had their code added to this project, let me know, as this project is about improving not only the gaming community, but the open source community as well.

I'm expecting on keeping the software entirely functional for everyday as it's developed, so the bot will provide the core card-bot functionality that everyone loves. Unless stated otherwise, any other raw releases shouldn't be downloaded, as they are most likely severely broken.

If you've written code dealing with anything interesting, and are willing to to share, it will speed up the initial process of having aa fully functional (perhaps not optimized) piece of software.
